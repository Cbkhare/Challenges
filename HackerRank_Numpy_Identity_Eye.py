identity

The identity tool returns an identity array. An identity array is a square matrix with all the main diagonal elements as 11 and the rest as 00. The default type of elements is float.

import numpy
print numpy.identity(3) #3 is for  dimension 3 X 3

#Output
[[ 1.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.]]

eye

The eye tool returns a 2-D array with 11's as the diagonal and 00's elsewhere. The diagonal can be main, upper or lower depending on the optional parameter kk. A positive kk is for the upper diagonal, a negative kk is for the lower, and a 00 kk (default) is for the main diagonal.

import numpy
print numpy.eye(8, 7, k = 1)    # 8 X 7 Dimensional array with first upper diagonal 1.

#Output
[[ 0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]

print numpy.eye(8, 7, k = -2)   # 8 X 7 Dimensional array with second lower diagonal 1.

Task

Your task is to print an array of size NNXMM with its main diagonal elements as 11's and 00's everywhere else.

Input Format

A single line containing the space separated values of NN and MM.
NN denotes the rows.
MM denotes the columns.

Output Format

Print the desired NNXMM array.

Sample Input

3 3

Sample Output

[[ 1.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.]]
